This is a Wordpress plugin that allows you to easily manage and showcase a grid of your portfolio items. 

== Description ==

This plugin integrates a stripped down bootstrap scaffolding in order to allow you to showcase a full screen / full width grid of portfolio items on your site. Simply use the shortcode to place your grid anywhere you want. A custom content type called "Shift8 Portfolio" is created for you to manage internally. You have the option of having a separate single page for each portfolio item added (that you will arrive when you click the image in the grid). If no additional information is given in the backend then clicking the image in the grid will simply enlarge it as a modal window.

You can see a demo of the plugin in use on our own [web design](https://www.shift8web.ca/our_work/ "Toronto Web Design") portfolio page.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/shift8-portfolio` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the shortcode markup anywhere in your site 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the shortcode options? =

An example shortcode would be the following :

<pre>
[shift8_portfolio numposts="10"]
</pre>


= How can I style the markup? =

You can either style the content by using the built-in Wordpress WYSIWYG editor or you can apply CSS styling to the custom classes that are generated in the markup. There will be general "catch-all" CSS classes generated and custom per-shortcode classes that will allow you to style each markup individually, or all at once.

= How do I change the number of grid items per row? =

Unfortunately this is not possible at this point. Eventually a number will be passed via shortcode options in a future version very soon!

= What else have you done? =

We do [toronto web design](https://www.shift8web.ca "Toronto Web Design") :)

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the main view of the portfolio items. If your theme allows for full width containers, then it will fill 100% of the width. The portfolio items are using bootstrap scaffolding
2. This is a single portfolio item. Your gallery will appear under the main image and the text subsequent to that
